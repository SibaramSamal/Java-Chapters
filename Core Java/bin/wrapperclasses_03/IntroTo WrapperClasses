Defn:
	The classes which  represents the premetive data types as object.
Separate wrapper classes are there for each type of premitive type. Among all, 6 are numeric type which are sub class of Number class.
Each wrapper class having xxxValue() to return the internal premitive value of that object.
	
Template of Integer Class:	
===========================		
public final Integer extends Number{
	private final int value;
	public Integer(int value){
		this.value = value;
	}
}	
we can instantiate wrapper class object in two ways.
	1.Using constructors (deprecated)
	2.Using valueOf(premitive Dta type) 
	
 (object instanciateUsing constructor)	|	(using valueOf())
 		Integer i = new Integer(5);		|	Integer i = Integer.valueOf();
 							
to get the value of the objects we have these methods.

		Byte - public byte byteValue();
		Short - public short shortValue();
		
		Integer - public abstract int intValue();
		Long - public abstract int intValue();
		Float - public abstract int intValue();
		Double - public abstract int intValue();
		
		Character - public char charValue();
		Boolean - public boolean booleanValue();
Number class is an abstract class and these methods are implemented in it's sub classes(Wrapper Classes)
